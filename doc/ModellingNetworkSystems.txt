<h1>The Store and Forward Model

	The purpose of this study is to provide the reader with a useful approach to learning just
	about any real system present in the shared reality and thereby to gain an overview of
	reality which can easily and objectively be shared with others, in so doing you may be able to
	outsmart the AI's which we are currently making.

	Consider a system with a source and a receiver joined by a single channel, with an 
	intervening accumulator. Forwarded items may be processed before being forwarded.

		Source ------>---- Storage/Accumulator ---->--- Receiver
		or
		Source ------>---- Storage/Accumulator ---->--- Processor --->--- Receiver
		           
	This study examines this model as it applies to a large variety of systems in various
	forms. We can call this model Store and Forward Flow. As we do this, and if we
	require the detail, we can examine the mathematical formulae used to describe the flow 
	at various points etc.

<h1>Some Examples of the Model

	These are the top level example views, which give us an overview/description of the system.

	Transport:

		Petrol -->--- Car --->--- Motion

	Electronics:

		Positive Potential ---->------ Capacitor ----->-- Meter ---> Ground -->

		Positive Potential ---->------- Battery ---->---- Device --> Ground -->

	Computing:

		Data --->--- Memory --->--- Display

		Input --->--- Memory --->--- Process --->--- Output

	Neuroscience:

		Sensory Input --->--- Memory --->--- Recall

	Biology:

		Sun Light --->--- Leaf --->--- Tree and Branches --->--- Termites

		Sun Light --->--- Grass --->--- Antelope --->--- Lion --->

		Sun Light --->--- Grain --->--- Chicken --->--- Human --->

	Earth System:

		Solar Energy ---->---- Atmosphere ---->---- Reradiation

	Economics:

		Income ----->---- Savings ----->----- Spending ---->

	Maths:

		Measurements --->--- Symbolic Representation --->--- Symbolic Manipulations ---->--- Calculated Results 

	Psychology:

		Stimuli --->--- Mind --->---- Behaviour

	Note that the life flows have complex intervening pathways, which are then
	amenable to study in more detail, if we require. Also that the flows may
	consist of more than one element - ie: water and sugars.

	Also note that the life flows are materially transformational, the accumulators
	undergo transformation as they are replenished.

	As we zoom-in on these models we can see more and more of the intervening links.

<h2>Example with Water Flow
						F	  A 	 F2
		Head of Water --->-- Tank  -->-- Receptacle

	If the tank has an outflow above the level of the base of the tank then there will no
	flow to the receptacle until the threshold is reached.

	Let us define the flow from the head has F (vol/second). Then the flow into the tank
	is F * t. The volume of the tank to the outflow pipe is A. So the time taken to reach
	the outflow is:

		A / F

	We can further refine our model by defining the pressure potential at the head f, 
	the resistance of the pipe r to define the flow.

		F = f/r

	Further examination of the resistance might relate the diameter d of the pipe to its
	resistance

		r = k / pi * (d/2)^2

	As you can see we can begin with simple Store and Forward Flow Model and then build in
	the required details, detail level by detail level.

	We can call the top level zooming-out and the detail zooming-in.

<h1>Studying The Model

	It should be noted that we do not have to make use of mathematics to gain a detailed
	understanding of these systems. We simply use mathematics when want learn about
	quantities and flows in the system, or any aspect that we wish to measure or 
	calculate.

	Let's use the following example, to study or analyse a system in more detail

		Petrol --->--- Car --->--- Motion

<h2>Zoom-in

							CAR
		1) Petrol -->-- Tank -->-- Engine -->-- Motion

												    CAR
		2) Petrol -->-- Tank -->-- Cylinder -->-- Piston -->-- CrankShaft -->-- Axle -->-- Wheel -->--- Motion

	Now we can start to branch the system to show separate flows (outputs / by-products)

													Motion
		2) Petrol -->-- Tank -->-- Cylinder -->-- Piston -->-- CrankShaft -->-- Axle -->-- Wheel -->--- Motion
									|
									V Exhaust
									|
									Exhaust Pipe -->-- Atmosphere	

<h2>Zoom-out

	Sometimes we have bits and pieces of information about a system not arranged in any particular fashion,
	for example, we are looking at the savannah and see some zebra, lions and hyenas wandering about. We hardly
	even know that they form a system. We know that lions eat zebras and we know that hyenas eat carcasses. We
	also know that lions have stomachs to digest meat.
	ie:
	Savannah
	Savannah has Grass
	Zebra
	Zebra eat Grass
	Lion
	Lion eat Zebra
	Lions have Stomachs
	Hyena
	Hyena eat Carcasses

	We can pick-out the top-level details as follows:
												  
	Savannah --->--- Grass --->--- Zebra --->--- Lion 
												  |
												  V
												  |
												Carcass -->-- Hyena
													

<h2>Extension

	We can add-in branches and extend the scope of the system to incorporate other
	impinging parts and incorporate feedback.
