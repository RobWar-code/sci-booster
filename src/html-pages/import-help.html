### JSON Inputs / Outputs

This feature allows for the importation/exportation of data for 
other sources, notably ChatGPT, in which the data may be easily 
edited for import.

The following definition is known as the "Sci-Booster Flow Model 
JSON Definition Version 1.8"

The purpose of this section is to describe the required format 
of the flow-model JSON object for data imports to the app. This 
is provided for both AI's such as ChatGPT and human contributors.

The import data may also have been obtained as an export from 
the app database, in this case id fields will be set. Such exports 
can be edited.

JSON Models supplied as updates without id fields must preserve 
title, label and hierarchical_id fields for the data items to be 
updated, although new items can be added in an update.

#### Descriptive Details
A flow model consists of pages of component nodes and flow lines 
used to describe a flow system. The pages are defined as a 
heirarchy of descriptive detail for each component node as 
required. For example, a top-level flow model might be:

Petrol Station --flow:petrol->-- Car --flow:exhaust-->- Atmosphere

- Fictional/example data should not be used in the json fields, 
they should be left with "" or null values if not known
- The "complete" field must be included to indicate whether the
whole model is being described or only certain pages (true/false)
- The top level (page) of a flow model has upto four nodes and all 
subsequent pages are further definitions of the component nodes 
that they describe.
- The flow_model_title should always be present at the top level 
and must the same as for the first page of hierarchical_id "01"
- The "id" field of each field where shown below of the json model 
should be present and set to null unless it is known via the site 
database from a data export.
- The hierarchical_id of the top-level page is "01" and its 
details apply to the whole model as well as the page that they 
describe.
- All definitions (nodes / pages) should confine themselves to the 
constraint of the parent.
- Pages inherit the flows from their parent node (whether source 
or destination), ideally they should be re-presented in the page
- It is permitted to have more than one flow from a component 
(as in motion and exhaust for a car with a petrol flow input, for 
example)
- A page should not consist of more than 8 component nodes
- A node number (NodeNum) is unique to a page only and consists of 
two digits, ie: "01".
- The node "type" field should be "mechanism" or "effect". 
"mechanism" simply means physical unit, "effect" is for output 
conditions such as "pollution" or "explosion"
- A hierarchical_id is built from its parent node numbers in order 
of descent, ie: "010204".
- When using keyword fields, beware of terms such as "flow" which 
are likely to be too common to be useful
- Flows are used to connect component nodes and their positions 
should be calculated as such

#### Visual Spatial Information for The Flow Diagram

The drawing area (stage) onto which a flow diagram page is drawn 
is 380 pixels wide by 690 pixels high.

##### Component Node Boxes

The stage area is sufficent for upto 8 component nodes, if 
arranged vertically in sets of 4. So eight is the maximum number 
of component nodes for a page.

Component nodes are represented by rectangular boxes 140 pixels 
wide by 75 pixels high.

On the drawing, vertically arranged component node should be 
spaced 90 pixels between the base of one node and the top of 
another (ie: node y coordinates are 165 pixels apart).

When there are more than 4 component nodes the node boxes should 
be offset from the left margin edge of the stage by 5 pixels for 
left hand column and margin of 5 pixels on theon the right, for 
the right hand column.

The position of the component node is given in node "x" and "y" 
fields, this is the top left corner of the component node box.

##### Flow Representations

All flow coordinates are relative to the "drawing_group_x" and 
"drawing_group_y" coordinates, which typically set to the 
position of the flow line described below.

Flows are represented by sets of line segments whose coordinates 
are given in the flow "points" field, each start/end points of 
the set of line segments should be given.

Generally the flow lines connect a source component node box to 
a destination node box, typically from the bottom of one box to 
the top of another.

The flow details include an "arrow_points" field for defining the 
coordinates of each of the 4 nodes of an equilateral triangle, of 
which the bottom side is indented toward the apex by two pixels, 
that sits on the flow line and points toward the destination.
The triangle is about 10 pixels high.

The flow label appears in a box, who's top-left coordinates are 
given in the "label_x", "label_y" fields.

The "label_width" field can be set to 60 by default, this is 
calculated from flow label text anyway.
